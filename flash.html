        <div class="flashcard" id="question9">
            <div class="question">DHCP/TCP-IP Question 1: What does DHCP stand for, and what is its primary function in a network?</div>
            <div class="answer hidden">Answer: DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and it's used to automatically assign IP addresses and network configuration settings to devices.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flashcard" id="question10">
            <div class="question">DHCP/TCP-IP Question 2: What does TCP/IP stand for, and what are the two main protocols in this suite?</div>

        </div>
        <div class="flashcard" id="question11">
            <div class="question">DHCP/TCP-IP Question 3: How does DHCP enhance network configuration within the TCP/IP suite?</div>
            <div class="answer hidden">Answer: DHCP assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server addresses to devices, making network configuration easier and more efficient.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flashcard" id="question12">
            <div class="question">Switches, Bridges, and Nodes Question 1: What is the primary difference between switches and bridges in networking, and which OSI layer do they operate at?</div>
            <div class="answer hidden">Answer: Switches are more advanced and efficient than bridges and operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flashcard" id="question13">
            <div class="question">Switches, Bridges, and Nodes Question 2: How do switches and bridges determine where to forward Ethernet frames in a network?</div>
            <div class="answer hidden">Answer: They examine MAC addresses in Ethernet frames and forward frames only to the appropriate port where the destination device is located.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flashcard" id="question14">
            <div class="question">Switches, Bridges, and Nodes Question 3: What is the primary advantage of switches over bridges in reducing network congestion?</div>
